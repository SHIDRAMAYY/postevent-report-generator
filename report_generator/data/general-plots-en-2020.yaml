      Dear sponsor,

      PyCon TW jinja2_tag_year had an exciting and fulfilling time because of your help. This year,
      we provided more than jinja2_tag_FA_amount USD financial aid to engage a wider communities.
      For example, people who have significantly contributed to the Python communities,
      or people and students who are not able to attend due to economic considerations.
      This greatly enhanced our community diversity. This became possible only because of you,
      our sponsors.
      </p>

      This year, we have in total jinja2_tag_year python enthusiast who joined us virtually or in person in Tainan,
      Taiwan. Most of them who had been in Taiwan were joining in person.

      This year, jinja2_tag_proposals brilliant talks were shared with the participants.
